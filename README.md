#  Beginner-Friendly Web Development Showcase
 Embark on your web development journey with this project, where the codes of a simple and straightforward website developed during a brief two-week internship are shared. The primary goal of publishing this on GitHub is to provide an open-source codebase for individuals who aspire to develop websites using basic HTML, CSS, and PHP.
